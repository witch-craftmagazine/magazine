Trivia: Written by Enocori and edited with some extras by StarSweetpea for the Halloween edition of Witch-Craft Magazine (seen on page 42). There was so much content we decided to only show part of the journal and place the full book at the top of the abandoned Soulcorp building on Deathcap for players/readers to find.
