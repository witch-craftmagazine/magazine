<!-- Anything in brackets that start with an exclamation mark, like this, is called a comment! It will not affect the HTML of your page. It's just a note from me to you! -->
<!-- There's a little extra HTML I've added here to jazz up the front page, but you don't need it! If you just want basic HTML with p tags and h1 tags and such, that will also work just fine. -->

<!-- The front page uses a responsive 2-column layout. This is done by first defining what content is going to be in the column layout, like so. -->
<div class="right-column-layout">
<!-- For this page, I've used a layout where the right column is wider than the left. If you want the left column to be wider than the right, change the class to "left-column-layout"! -->

<!-- Next, we separate what we want into the left and right columns. -->
    <div class="left-column">
        <a href="https://github.com/ryanvilbrandt/comic_git/wiki">
            <img src="your_content/images/logo.png" alt="comic_git logo: if you can draw it, you can build it!" title="Click here to go to the comic_git wiki!">
        </a>
    </div>

    <div class="right-column">
        <h1>Welcome to comic_git!</h1>

        <p>What you're seeing is the default website created by comic_git, a static-site generator hosted FOR FREE on GitHub Pages, that YOU can use to publish your own web comic easily and quickly!</p>

        <!-- If you want to make your link look like a button, add class="button" to your 'a' tag like so: -->
        <a class="button" href="comic/197/#comic-page">First Page</a>

        <a class="button" href="latest/#comic-page">Latest Page</a>

        <p>Click <a href="comic/197/#comic-page">here</a> to go to the first page of the sample comic to see how it looks out-of-the-box.<br>
            You can also click <a href="latest/#comic-page">here</a> to go to the latest page, which will always point to the most recently published comic.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<!-- That's the end of the column layout! Everything below this is just normal HTML. -->
