/*
Change these options to customize the color scheme and a few layout options of your website.
Most layout options are stored in src/css/advanced_stylesheet.css. I do not recommend messing with those settings
unless you know what you're doing, or you're willing to spend a lot of time on trial and error.

For any colors, you can represent them in hexadecimal like this (#FF0000 = red)
or use this list of available color names: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp
